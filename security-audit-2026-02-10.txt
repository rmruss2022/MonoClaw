DAILY SECURITY AUDIT - February 10, 2026

🔒 SUMMARY
✅ PASSED: 8 checks
⚠️ WARNINGS: 5 issues
🚨 CRITICAL: 4 urgent items

📊 TOKEN USAGE:
- Current: 0k / 256k (0%)
- Trend: stable
- Sessions: 12 active

=============================================
🚨 CRITICAL FINDINGS
=============================================

1. GATEWAY SERVICE DOWN
   Severity: CRITICAL
   The OpenClaw gateway service is not running. All cron operations fail
   and agent functionality is impaired. Service must be restarted.

2. EXPOSED API KEYS IN LAUNCHAGENT
   Severity: CRITICAL
   File: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
   Token: OPENCLAW_GATEWAY_TOKEN is visible in plaintext
   Risk: Any user can read the full gateway authentication token

3. EXPOSED CREDENTIALS IN MOLTBOOK_CONFIG.md
   Severity: CRITICAL
   Moltbook API key exposed in workspace documentation
   Key: moltbook_sk_INf7-5a5KWpzlt3pxbMOQL6PG81-gULG

4. FIREWALL DISABLED
   Severity: CRITICAL
   macOS Application Firewall is disabled (State = 0)
   System has no network-level protection

=============================================
⚠️ WARNINGS
=============================================

1. OPENCLAW.JSON CONTAINS MULTIPLE SECRETS
   Severity: HIGH
   The main config file contains plaintext credentials:
   - NVIDIA API key (nvapi-...)
   - Brave Search API key
   - Telegram bot token
   - Discord bot token
   - Gateway auth token
   - Hooks token
   - Gmail push token
   
   File permissions are correct (600 - owner only)
   but credentials should ideally use keychain/secure storage

2. NO PACKAGE-LOCK FOR DEPENDENCY AUDIT
   Severity: MEDIUM
   No lock file prevents npm audit from scanning for known vulnerabilities
   in OpenClaw dependencies

3. .DS_Store FILES IN WORKSPACE
   Severity: LOW
   macOS metadata files may leak system information
   (Already properly gitignored)

4. LAUNCHAGENT PROLIFERATION
   Severity: LOW
   11 LaunchAgents installed - increases startup time and attack surface
   All appear to be OpenClaw-related but should be reviewed periodically

5. WEBHOOK HOOKS ENABLED
   Severity: MEDIUM
   Gmail webhook configured with push notifications
   Potential phishing vector if tokens compromised

=============================================
✅ RECOMMENDATIONS (Top 3)
=============================================

1. RESTART GATEWAY IMMEDIATELY
   Command: launchctl load ~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist
   Or: openclaw gateway start

2. ENABLE MACOS FIREWALL
   System Settings -> Network -> Firewall -> ON
   Or: sudo /usr/libexec/ApplicationFirewall/socketfilterfw --setglobalstate on

3. ROTATE EXPOSED TOKNS
   - Regenerate Telegram bot token via @BotFather
   - Regenerate Discord token via Discord Developer Portal
   - Consider securing OpenClaw config with keychain/git-crypt

=============================================
