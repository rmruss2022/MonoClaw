# Fun Lobster Facts 🦞

- **Lobsters are biologically immortal** - They don't age in the traditional sense and can theoretically live forever! They die from exhaustion during molting or getting eaten, not old age.

- **They pee out of their faces** - Lobsters have urine release nozzles right under their eyes. They communicate by peeing at each other, which can signal either aggression or attraction depending on the chemical composition.

- **Blue lobsters are real but super rare** - Only about 1 in 2 million lobsters are bright blue due to a genetic mutation that produces excess protein. There are also yellow, orange, and even albino lobsters!

- **Lobsters were once considered "poor people food"** - In colonial America, lobsters were so abundant they washed up on beaches in piles 2 feet high. They were fed to prisoners, servants, and used as fertilizer. Eating lobster was actually embarrassing!

- **They taste with their legs** - Lobsters have chemosensory hairs on their legs and feet that allow them to "taste" food as they walk around. They also chew with their stomachs using a structure called a "gastric mill."
