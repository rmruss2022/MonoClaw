# Productivity Tips

- **Time-block your calendar** — Schedule specific tasks in 90-minute chunks with 15-minute breaks. Treat these blocks like unmovable meetings to prevent context-switching.

- **Two-minute rule** — If a task takes less than 2 minutes, do it immediately instead of adding it to your list. Prevents small tasks from accumulating into mental clutter.

- **Close all tabs at EOD** — Bookmark what matters, close everything else. Start each day with a clean slate instead of 47 half-finished thoughts competing for attention.

- **Single-tasking sprints** — Pick ONE task, set a 25-minute timer, disable notifications, and do nothing else. Quality work happens in focused bursts, not fragmented hours.

- **Evening brain dump** — Spend 5 minutes before bed writing tomorrow's top 3 priorities. Your brain stops rehearsing tasks overnight when they're captured externally.
