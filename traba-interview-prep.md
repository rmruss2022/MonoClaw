## 📋 Experience Examples (Tailored to SDE Role)

### Example 1: Full-Stack Development & System Architecture
**Situation:** *At [Company], we needed to build a real-time dashboard for tracking complex data flows.*

**Task:** Design and implement both frontend and backend systems that could handle high throughput while maintaining sub-second latency.

**Action:**
- Built React/TypeScript frontend with optimized state management
- Designed RESTful APIs and WebSocket connections for real-time updates
- Implemented Redis caching layer to reduce database load
- Set up monitoring with proper observability (logging, metrics, alerting)

**Result:** System handled 10K+ concurrent users with 99.9% uptime. Reduced page load times by 60% and improved user engagement by 40%.

**Relevance to Traba:** This experience directly applies to building worker/business-facing dashboards and real-time matching systems that Traba's platform requires.

---

### Example 2: AI/ML Integration & Data-Driven Features
**Situation:** *[Previous project] required implementing predictive algorithms to optimize user matching.*

**Task:** Integrate ML models into production systems while maintaining low latency and high reliability.

**Action:**
- Collaborated with data scientists to deploy models into production
- Built feature pipelines and model inference infrastructure
- Implemented A/B testing framework to validate model performance
- Optimized for latency while maintaining prediction quality

**Result:** Improved matching accuracy by 35%, reduced false positives by 50%, and maintained <100ms p99 latency.

**Relevance to Traba:** Directly applicable to Traba's worker-job matching algorithms, predictive scheduling, and reliability scoring systems.

---

### Example 3: Rapid Iteration & Startup Velocity
**Situation:** *Early-stage startup environment with ambiguous requirements and competing priorities.*

**Task:** Ship features quickly while maintaining code quality and technical debt under control.

**Action:**
- Embraced rapid prototyping with iterative feedback loops
- Wrote clean, maintainable code with proper testing (unit, integration, E2E)
- Made pragmatic technical decisions balancing speed vs. scalability
- Collaborated cross-functionally with product, design, and ops

**Result:** Shipped 3 major features in 2 months, all of which became core to the product. Maintained <2% bug rate in production.

**Relevance to Traba:** Startup environment requires engineers who can move fast, make smart trade-offs, and deliver business value without creating technical debt disasters.
