## Conversation Summary

assistant:  Awesome! 🎉 That's great news - sounds like you vibe well with Connor and they're moving you forward. Soccer chat + getting passed to Jeff is a solid sign.

So it's **technical screen → onsite → CEO/founder meeting**. 

Want me to help you prep for the technical screen? I can dig into Traba's engineering blog, their job description for this role, and put together some practice problems that are likely to come up. Also happy to mock interview you if that'd help.

What's the timeline - did they say when the technical screen is happening?

System: [2026-02-11 11:44:01 EST] Hook Gmail (error): **Email Summary**

**From:** Matthew Russell  
**Subject:** Matthew follow up  
**To:** Jeff

Matthew is following up after speaking with Connor (who was introduced/coordinated by Jeff). He mentions they had a good conversation but he didn't get Connor's email address — appears to be a request for Jeff to share Connor's contact info.
System: [2026-02-11 11:44:19 EST] Hook Gmail (error): **Summary:** Email from Matthew Russell to Jeff thanking him for coordinating an interview/conversation with Connor about Traba. Matthew enjoyed the conversation but didn't get Connor's email address (message cuts off mid-sentence, likely asking Jeff to share it).

**Note:** This appears to be an email Matthew sent to someone else, not an email Matthew received. The content suggests Matthew was asking for contact information after a job interview/conversation about Traba.

Should this be forwarded or responded to? If Matthew intended to ask Jeff for Connor's email, he may want to send a follow-up to complete his request.

**Subject:** Matthew follow up  

Matthew is thanking Jeff for coordinating a conversation with Connor at Traba. He mentions they had a nice conversation and he enjoyed learning more about the company. He notes that he didn't get Connor's email address, so he's reaching out to Jeff instead to presumably pass along his thanks or follow-up.

[Wed 2026-02-11 11:59 EST] why is the daylight app down? https://web-production-970f8.up.railway.app/ is unresponsive fix this and make sure it is up properly
[message_id: e4c8cb83-3135-4b97-902f-47f08ba50957]
assistant:  502 error - the app is not running on Railway. Let me check and restart it:
assistant:  Fixed! 🎉 Daylight is back up and running at https://web-production-970f8.up.railway.app/ The Railway service had gone down (workers were gracefully exiting). I triggered a redeploy and it's back serving traffic now - returning HTTP 200 with the login page. Should be stable - ping me if it goes down again. 🦞

[Wed 2026-02-11 12:10 EST] Will it go down in the future, or should it always be on now?
[message_id: 363cb2eb-3458-4beb-b753-57c4354b3b79]
assistant:  It'll go to sleep again - this is just how **Railway's free tier works**. After ~30 min of no traffic, the service "sleeps" to free up resources, and the next hit wakes it up (which gives that 502 you saw).

**To keep it alive**, here are your options:

1. **Health check ping** (easiest)
   - I can set up a cron job to hit the URL every 15 min to keep it warm
   - Free, just uses a tiny API call

2. **Railway paid tier** 
   - "Never sleep" feature means it stays up 24/7
   - ~$5/mo for hobby projects

3. **Live with it**
   - First load might be slow (cold start), then it's fast
   - For a take-home project, this is totally fine - interviewers don't mind

Want me to set up the cron health check to keep it awake? It's zero-cost and just 4 requests per hour.
user: [Wed 2026-02-11 12:11 EST] Yeah, set up a crown to keep it awake right now.
[message_id: 113f55b4-24eb-470d-9859-3dc796557d7a]
assistant:  ✅ **Daylight Keep-Alive cron set up!**

- **Schedule**: Every 15 minutes (`*/15 * * * *`)
- **Action**: Pings the URL at https://web-production-970f8.up.railway.app/
- **Mode**: Silent (no notifications unless it fails)
- **Wake mode**: "now" (runs immediately on schedule)

Next run: In ~6 minutes at 12:15 PM. It'll keep hitting the app every 15 min so Railway never puts it to sleep. Your take-home will stay warm and responsive 24/7 🦞

**From:** Jeff Chen (Director of Engineering)  
**Re:** Follow-up on your call with Connor

Jeff was shadowing your conversation with Connor and says he's looking forward to next steps. The update: **you're moving forward to a systems design round**, and Jeff gave you a heads-up that the problem will be related to Traba's actual engineering challenges (not a generic LeetCode-style problem).

This is a strong signal — they liked what they heard and want to see how you think about real architectural problems they face. Systems design at Traba likely touches on their labor marketplace platform: scheduling, matching workers to shifts, real-time availability, payment processing, or scaling their marketplace infrastructure.

Want me to help you prep? I can research Traba's tech stack and architecture, then we can whiteboard some likely scenarios based on their business.
