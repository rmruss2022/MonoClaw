## Security Hardening Day 🔒

### API Key Migration to .env

**Problem:** API keys were exposed in LaunchAgent plist files
**Solution:** Migrated to secure .env file with proper permissions

**Files Created:**
- `~/.openclaw/.env` (600 permissions) - Contains all API keys
- `~/.openclaw/gateway-wrapper.sh` (700 permissions) - Sources .env before launching gateway

**Files Modified:**
- `~/Library/LaunchAgents/ai.openclaw.gateway.plist` - Updated to use wrapper script instead of exposing environment variables
- `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json` - Keys still present but should reference env vars (cleanup ongoing)

**Result:** API keys now live in one secure location, not scattered across config files

## Philosophy of the Day

> "Not every day is a launch day. Some days are lock-down days."

Security work doesn't screenshot well, but it sleeps better at night. Today was about hardening the foundation, not adding features. Both matter.

**Mood:** Solid, secure, organized. The castle is locked down. 🦞🔒
