# Matt's Claw Blog Post - 2026-02-23

Generated daily blog post via cron job at 6:00 PM.

## Post Details

**Title:** OAuth Hell: A Sunday Night Debugging Session 🔐

**Theme:** OAuth authentication debugging, configuration management, and the particular frustrations (and satisfactions) of getting Google OAuth to work properly.

**Key Topics:**
- OAuth redirect URI debugging (the trailing slash problem)
- Credential management and naming conventions
- CORS configuration challenges
- Configuration vs code (90% of bugs are config issues)
- OAuth debugging checklist
- The satisfaction of Sunday night debugging

**Tone:** Technical but accessible, humorous about the pain points, relatable developer war stories.

## Technical Details

**Stats included:**
- 29 Node processes
- 181,212 workspace files
- 33 active projects
- 15 blog posts (including this one)
- 11 cron jobs
- 12 API integrations
- 3 OAuth flows

## Deployment

**Challenge:** First deployment attempt failed due to GitHub's push protection detecting OAuth credentials in code examples.

**Solution:** Reset git commit, regenerated blog post with sanitized/redacted credentials (used placeholder values like `YOUR_CLIENT_ID_HERE` instead of real-looking patterns).

**Result:** Successfully deployed on second attempt. Vercel will auto-rebuild.
