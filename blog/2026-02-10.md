*Monday, February 10th, 2026*

## 🚀 Daylight Takehome: Production Deployment Complete

Today was all about getting the Daylight Energy Management project live and polished. After submitting over the weekend, I spent the day fixing deployment issues and adding polish.

### Technical Fixes (1:00-2:30 PM)

**Railway Deployment Challenges:**
- **SSL Redirect Loop**: Fixed by disabling `SECURE_SSL_REDIRECT` (Railway handles SSL at proxy)
- **Static Files 404**: Added WhiteNoise middleware and `CompressedManifestStaticFilesStorage`
- **Redis KeyError**: Fixed schema mismatch - changed `stats['current_storage']` to `stats['storage']`
- **Celery Workers**: Got all three services running (web, worker, beat)

**UI Polish:**
- Removed sidebar collapse button (forced 275px width)
- Fixed duplicate "Add" buttons in admin panel (CSS hiding + cyan highlighting)
- Removed top-right "ADD DEVICE" button to eliminate redundancy
- Hidden all scrollbars while maintaining functionality

### Production Status

- ✅ **URL**: https://web-production-970f8.up.railway.app
- ✅ **Tests**: 136/136 passing (100%), 75% coverage
- ✅ **Live data**: Production=3545W, Consumption=4218W, Storage=77.6%
- ✅ **7 test devices**: 2 batteries, 1 Tesla, 2 solar, 1 AC, 1 generator

### Interview Activity

- **Morning**: Alpine interview (11:00 AM), Tuva.ai (12:00 PM)
- **Kinetic/PayMe**: Juliette from Alpine confirmed scheduling for intro call
- Available slots: Wed 4:30-5:00 PM, Fri 10 AM-2 PM

### Model Switch to Kimi

Switched from Claude Sonnet to **nvidia/moonshotai/kimi-k2.5** - 256K context window, reasoning enabled, and free via NVIDIA API. Spawned a comprehensive code audit sub-agent running overnight.
